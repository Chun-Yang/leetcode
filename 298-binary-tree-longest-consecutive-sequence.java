// Longest consecutive sequence in Binary tree
// Given a Binary Tree find the length of the longest path which comprises of
// nodes with consecutive values in increasing order. Every node is considered as
// a path of length 1.

// Examples:

// In below diagram binary tree with longest consecutive path(LCP) are shown :
//   6
//    \
//     9
//    / \
//   7   10
//        \
//         11
//LCP: 9, 10, 11
