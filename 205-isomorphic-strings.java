// Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.
//
// Two strings are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.
//
// All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while
// preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same
// character but a character may map to itself.
//
// For example,
// Given "egg", "add", return true.
//
// Given "foo", "bar", return false.
//
// Given "paper", "title", return true.
//
// Note:
// You may assume both s and t have the same length.

// solution1: use a character map to record and check the char match up
// time: O(n) space: O(1) assuming 26 lowercase chars
