// Find the total area covered by two rectilinear rectangles in a 2D plane.
// Each rectangle is defined by its bottom left corner and top right corner as
// shown in the figure.
//
// NOTE: the two rectangles may overlap
//
//
// Assume that the total area is never beyond the maximum possible value of int.

// solution1: O(1)
// aTotal = - a1a2 + a1 + a2 (to avoid overflow)
// a1a2 = xOverlap * yOverlap
// xOverlap = Math.max(0, Math.min(right1, right2) - Math.max(left1, left2))
