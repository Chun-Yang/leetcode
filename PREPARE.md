## Knowledge

### Algorithems
- merge sort
- heap sort
- quick sort
- selection sort
- insertion sort
- bubble sort
- [?] radix sort
- [?] couting sort
- [?] bucket sort
- [?] topological sort
- two pointer(multiple pointers) with (constrain / boundary condition / invariance)
- slow fast pointers / cycle detection
- dynamic programming
- dfs
  - preorder
  - postorder
  - inorder
- bfs
- binary search
- backtracking
- greedy
- divide and counquer
- union find
- [?] spanning tree
- [?] minimum cuts
- Hierholzer's algorithm (greedy)
- [?] gcd

### Data Structures
- array
- stack
- queue
- deque
- set
- hash table
- binary search tree
- red-black tree ( balanced binary search tree )
- [?] binary indexed tree
- [?] segment tree
- heap / priority queue (java PriorityQueue can have duplicates)
- linked list
- trie

### Tricks
- (x & (x-1)) remove last bit
- (x & (-x)) extract last bit
- (x ^ y) ^ y is x

## Interview

### Intros
- more than 4 years building web applications
- build a converter to convert html to working react app with components as dependencies
- I design and build a custome enterprise content management software,
  we build a multi step form builder,
  its like a compiler that convert json like object into
  multi step form with validations and relationship constrains
  and the it team of our client provide the schema for the wizrds

### Approaches
- Listen and Ask: make sure I understand the questions
  - input format?
  - output format?
- Come up with a working plan: come up a plan first
- Improve: improve the plan using another algorithem
- Confirm: let the interviewer sign off my design
- Implementation plan: separte the algorithem in several parts and mark them.
- Implement
- Test
  - edge case
  - common case
- Debug

### Questions
- [tech] what is the biggest technical challenges you encourtered at facebook?
- [tech] which skill is most wanted in your day to day job?
  - algorithem design and development?
  - managing complexity in code?

  - communication skills?
- [tech] what were you doing recently, do you enjoy it and why?
- [culture] if you can give one advice to CEO, what would you say?
- [culture] which part excites you most working at facebook? and why?
