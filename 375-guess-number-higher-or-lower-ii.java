// We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

// I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.

// Every time you guess wrong,
// I'll tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower.

// However, when you guess a particular number x, and you guess wrong, you pay $x.
// You win the game when you guess the number I picked.

// Example:

// n = 10, I pick 8.

// First round:  You guess 5, I tell you that it's higher. You pay $5.
// Second round: You guess 7, I tell you that it's higher. You pay $7.
// Third round:  You guess 9, I tell you that it's lower. You pay $9.

// Game over. 8 is the number I picked.

// You end up paying $5 + $7 + $9 = $21.
// Given a particular n â‰¥ 1,
// find out how much money you need to have to guarantee a win.
